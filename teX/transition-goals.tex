\section{Short Term}
With regards to short-term goals, the most pressing issues currently are those of the funding poll and student election events. These applets are currently deprecated and need to be repaired as soon as possible. So, the short-term goals are to get these up and running once again. To summarize:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fix the Funding Poll widget
  \item Fix the Student Elections widget
\end{enumerate}

\section{Long Term}
For the long-term goals, there are two primary things to consider. First, the webmasters should start to think about the design and deployment of the events page on the website; this is the aforementioned project done in collaboration with OSE.

Secondly, the webmasters should begin the process of refactoring and commenting out the code in $app.js$. The code is currently messy and is in dire need of refactoring, so this is an important goal. To summarize:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Begin designing and thinking about the deployment of the events section of the website
  \item Start refactoring and commenting the source code in $app.js$
\end{enumerate}
