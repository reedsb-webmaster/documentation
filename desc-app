The Webmasters are responsible for ongoing development, maintenance, and updates to the Student Bodyâ€™s website reedsb.com. The two primary functions of reedsb.com is hosting Funding Poll for Treasury and Student Body Elections for Senate. It is possible that you may be asked to help Senate with some of their projects. In addition to these functions, the Webmaster is expected to communicate with the Office of Student Engagement regarding adding features to the website like making student club events more accessible.

The new webmaster will be trained by the current webmaster* on how to run reedsb.com. Along the way, the webmasters will learn how to use GoDaddy, Git, cPanel, Google Firebase to administer the website. The actual website is programmed with JavaScript, CSS, and PHP. The Webmaster is expected to regularly communicate with Treasury, the Senate Website Liaison, and the Office of Student of Engagement (who pays the wages).

Programming experience in Javascript and/or CSS + PHP is required, as well as a basic understanding of how web applications work. Applicants who do not have experience but are familiar are still encouraged to apply. Experience doing client-side web programming and database management using Google Firebase is recommended, but not required. You by no means need to be a good website manager or programmer, just willing to learn a lot.

*In the case that the current webmaster leaves, you may be promoted upon hiring.
